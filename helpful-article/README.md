### Requirements

I haven't specifically tested the plugin with PHP 7.4, but it should be compatible with version 7.4.

### Fingerprinting

Currently, the plugin utilizes only the user's IP address for fingerprinting. However, implementing more advanced browser fingerprinting techniques could enhance security and make vote manipulation more challenging.

### Restrictions

At present, each user (fingerprinted) is limited to a single vote. However, we store the timestamp of each vote, allowing for potential implementation of multiple votes with a cooldown period, such as 24 hours.

### Design

There are three approaches to implementing a plugin like this: via a shortcode, as a widget, or by injecting the voting block into post contents. I've opted for the latter method because it seamlessly integrates with any theme and requires no additional configuration steps.

### CSS/JS

To ensure compatibility with any theme, the plugin utilizes plain vanilla JavaScript for AJAX requests and DOM manipulation, avoiding the need for jQuery or React. The CSS, while somewhat repetitive, offers extensive control over customization by allowing edits to the theme's CSS files. While the HTML output is responsive, it may not be pixel-perfect across all themes.

### Data

Upon activation, the plugin creates a table to store votes. Notably, this table is not removed upon plugin deactivation, as it serves a purpose. If cleanup is required, corresponding post_meta values should also be removed.

### Tests

Currently, there are no unit tests implemented.

### I18N

The plugin is translation-ready and ships with support for two languages: English (en_US) and Ukrainian (uk).

### PSR

The code adheres to PSR-12 standards, with the exception of line lengths.

### Possible Improvements

- Enhanced CSS/design integration
- Implementation of unit tests
- Addition of a plugin configuration page in the dashboard
- Advanced fingerprinting techniques
- Support for multiple votes with a configurable cooldown period
- Implementation of a plugin uninstaller to remove all plugin data upon uninstallation
